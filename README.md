# Cristiano Faustino's Portfolio

This is the source code for the personal Portfolio published on https://cristianofaustino.me.

## Application Details

This application was originally built using JQuery 1.11.3, Bootstrap v3.3.5 and Angular v1.4.2 back in 2014.

In 2024 I have migrated it into a React.JS application, it has more robustness and customization to it.

### Implementation
The app uses JSON files for loading it's projects and skills, and new projects are easily maintainable without having to change the index.html structure.

It uses Bootstrap for responsiveness on different layouts, and a few customizations on Bootstrap stylings were made in order to be a more custom layout, as I didn't want this Portfolio to look exactly like Bootstrap's older layout, but still wanted the grid classes features from the framework.

To run it you'll have to do the following:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

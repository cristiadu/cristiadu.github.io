# Cristiano Faustino's Portfolio

This is the source code for the personal Portfolio published on https://cristianofaustino.me.

## Application Details

This application was built using JQuery 1.11.3, Bootstrap v3.3.5 and Angular v1.4.2 back in 2015, and a few changes, mostly surrounding layout & projects (not frameworks used), were made in the past couple of years.

I have a plan of switching this whole application to use a more robust framework like React.js or Vue.js in the future.

The change would be just to update it to latest technology, as Angular is still working pretty well for this purpose.

### Implementation

The app uses JSON files for loading it's projects and skills, and new projects are easily maintainable without having to change the index.html structure.

It uses Bootstrap for responsiveness on different layouts, and a few customizations on Bootstrap stylings were made in order to be a more custom layout, as I didn't want this Portfolio to look exactly like Bootstrap's older layout, but still wanted the grid classes features from the framework.

To run it you'll just need a regular browser access, as the website doesn't need compiling/building. When changing to a different newer framework in the future that might change.
